                  I've built several front-end projects using different tools. In my Join Kanban app, I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. I created a Valkyrie game using OOP in JavaScript, and built Pok√©mon Desk with a REST API. I also enjoy working with TypeScript, Angular, Material Design, and using Git in Scrum-based teams.

               <h3>I'm always excited to learn new technologies and frameworks. I enjoy exploring how different tools work together to build better, faster, and more dynamic applications. Whether it's diving into a new JavaScript framework, experimenting with backend services like Firebase, or refining UI with modern design systems, I love the challenge of staying up to date and constantly improving my skills.</h3>
